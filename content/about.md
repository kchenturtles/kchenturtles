Hello! My name is Kendree. 

I'm a student at Boston University Academy, part-time software developer, and co-president of gbSTEM, a nonprofit STEM education organization. I enjoy web development, especially UI/UX and frontend, and I'm also involved in a lot of competitive robotics! 

An interest of mine is using technology to address social and educational needs. Particularly, I am focused on promoting inclusion and diversity in STEM education.
