description: "Poseidon-Bot is an AI chatbot that uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) architecture to allow the model to specialize in documents uploaded by the user. This was a project I worked on as part of a summer internship with Boston University's SAIL Lab during the summer of 2024. I created the backend and RAG architecture and some of the frontend functionality."
